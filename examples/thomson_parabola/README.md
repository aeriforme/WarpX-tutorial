### What is this for?

This is a dummy example to show some of the main features of WarpX.
I set up this simulation without worrying about whether it makes physical sense or not.
This was a deliberate decision to make the point that: 
1) it's easy to set up and run a simulation without having a clue of what it might happen
2) it's easy to set up and run your first WarpX simulation 


The input file `inputs.txt` is a starting point to learn how to: 
* choose algorithms
* set up the grid
* choose time discretization 
* initialize particles' species
* save diagnostics 


The plotting script and notebook `plot.py` and `plot.ipynb` are a starting point to learn how to extract and visualize WarpX's data.
